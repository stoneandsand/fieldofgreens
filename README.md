## How To Start This App

************************************

Application instructions:

package.json in root folder contains some scripts for you to use in terminal. Run these commands in shell.

"npm run wp" will start webpack. Run it once and it will watch for any new changes and automatically transpile to browser-friendly code!

"npm run start" will start the server to accept incoming clients and also allow you to monitor the server in terminal.
